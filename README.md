## What is BMI? 🤔

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement that helps determine whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height. It's a useful indicator of whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2.
